# NPClassifer_local
This app is a local version of NPClassifier: https://github.com/mwang87/NP-Classifier <br>
Instead of having neural networks trained then hosted on UCSD servers, the neural networks are trained and stored in the 'trained_models' folder. This version of the app also has a 'batch processing' section so you can upload excel files and do multiple classifications at a time without needing to script.
